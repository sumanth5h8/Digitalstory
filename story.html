        <h1><center><u><b>Title:</b> Super Scribbler: Ayla’s Second Vision</u></center></h1>
<u class="si"><b>Theme:</b></u> An ordinary person finds an extraordinary way to overcome challenges.<br>
<u class="si"><b>Panel 1:</b></u> The Accident
•	Ayla is painting a colorful mural. Suddenly, a dramatic accident occurs (e.g., slipping on a spilled paint bucket), leading to her 
    losing her sight.
•	The caption: “When Ayla's world turned dark, her creativity dimmed too—or so she thought.”<br>
<u class="si"><b>Panel 2:</b></u> Meeting Liam
•	Ayla sulks in her room, ignoring her art supplies. Liam, a musician with sunglasses and a confident smile, knocks on her door 
    holding a guitar.
•	Liam: “Time to pick up that pencil, Ayla. Let’s see what you can still create!”<br>
<u class="si"><b>Panel 3:</b></u> The Magical Discovery
•	Ayla begrudgingly grabs her pencil but accidentally picks up a magical one—Sketchy.
•	Sketchy’s voice appears in the frame: “Finally! I’ve been waiting for you to unleash me!”
•	Ayla: “Wait… my pencil talks?”<br>
<u class="si"><b>Panel 4:</b></u> Tactile Art Adventure
•	Sketchy guides Ayla to create tactile art by drawing objects that come to life.
•	A flying dragon bursts from her sketchpad, surprising her.
•	Caption: “Who needs eyes when your imagination can see?”<br>
 
<u class="si"><b>Panel 5:</b></u> Facing Blinders
•	Blinders scoffs at Ayla’s exhibit at the community art center:
Blinders: “This is art? It’s just a jumble of textures!”
•	Ayla uses Sketchy to create a masterpiece—a blend of tactile sculptures and live music.<br>
<u class="si"><b>Panel 6:</b></u> The Big Triumph
•	The audience, including Blinders, is moved by the exhibit. Ayla holds Sketchy triumphantly.
Conclusion: “With her second vision, Ayla proved that art is about the soul, not just the eyes.”
